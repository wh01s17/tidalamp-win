"""What tells one layout from another, written as data.

A layout is the structure half of a look; the palette in `theme.py` is the
colour half. Everything the app used to ask with `if config.THEME == ...` is a
field here instead, so a new layout is one entry in `LAYOUT_TABLE` plus its
block of TCSS, and nothing in `app.py` has to learn its name.

The transport is the one part that stays code: each look draws its buttons
differently enough that a table of glyphs would be a program in disguise.
`transport` names the builder, `_transport_<name>` on the app.

"""Paths and user configuration.

Settings come from three places, and the first one that has an answer wins:

1. the environment (``TIDALAMP_QUALITY`` and friends), for a one-off run;
2. ``~/.config/tidalamp/config.toml``, for what you always want;
3. the defaults below.

TOML because Python reads it without a dependency, and because a config file
you can comment is worth more than one you cannot. That is also why writing is
done a line at a time by ``set_option()`` rather than by dumping a dict back:
a round trip through a parser would return the settings and throw away every
comment the user put around them.

An environment variable still wins over the file, so a setting the config
screen writes can be shadowed by one. ``overridden()`` reports that, because
a screen that showed a value the app is not using would be lying.

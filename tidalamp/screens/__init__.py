"""The modal windows stacked over the main panel: search, library, EQ, lyrics.

They own no player state. Each one is handed what it needs at construction —
a session, a loader, a `Settings` — and reports back through `dismiss`, which
is what keeps `app.py` from having to know how any of them are laid out.

`RowList` lives here rather than in `widgets.py` because it renders a
`library.Row`, and `library` imports tidalapi: putting it there would drag
TIDAL into the one module that is deliberately ignorant of it.

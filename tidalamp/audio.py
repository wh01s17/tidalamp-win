"""The audio stack under mpv: what the sink is, and whether it can do hi-res.

tidalamp asks TIDAL for 24/96 and hands mpv a FLAC that really is 24/96, and
then PipeWire resamples it to whatever single rate its graph is clamped to.
The badge says HI_RES_LOSSLESS and it is telling the truth about the stream;
the DAC still receives 48 kHz. Nothing in the player can see that, so this
module goes and looks.

Everything here shells out to tools that may not be installed and to a daemon
that may not be running. Every function answers with what it found rather than
raising, because none of it is on the path that plays music.

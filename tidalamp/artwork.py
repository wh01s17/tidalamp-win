"""Album art: fetch the cover and turn it into something a terminal can draw.

Three targets, in descending fidelity:

* **kitty graphics**, which draws real pixels above the text grid;
* **sixel**, DEC's older pixel format, still spoken by foot, mlterm, contour…;
* **half blocks**, which need no protocol at all: one cell becomes two pixels
  by painting a quadrant glyph in one colour over another, four samples to
  a cell.

Pillow is an optional dependency. Without it there is no decoder, so
:func:`decode` returns ``None``, the cover is simply not drawn, and nothing
else about the player changes — the same bargain as cava in `spectrum.py`.

This module knows nothing about Textual or tidalapi: it takes a URL and a box
measured in cells, and gives back either a pixel matrix or an escape sequence.

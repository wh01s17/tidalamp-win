"""Turn a TIDAL track into something mpv can open.

TIDAL hands back two shapes of manifest:

``BTS``
    A plain list of progressive URLs (HIGH / LOW, and often LOSSLESS). mpv
    plays the first URL directly.

``MPD``
    A segmented DASH manifest (typical for LOSSLESS / HI_RES_LOSSLESS).
    tidalapi already parses the segment templates for us, so we render the
    segments as a local HLS playlist and point mpv at that file.

Asking for a quality is not the same as getting it. Measured against a real
account on 2026-09-08: with the device-flow client, TIDAL answers ``HIGH`` to
both ``LOSSLESS`` and ``HI_RES_LOSSLESS`` even on a subscription whose own
endpoint reports ``HI_RES`` as available. ``Playable.downgraded`` says so
rather than letting the display imply we got what we asked for.

Tracks whose manifest is encrypted are DRM-protected: mpv cannot decrypt them
and we say so instead of failing with a codec error.

    A DASH manifest's first segment is the initialisation segment: ``ftyp`` and

    ``moof``/``mdat`` — audio with no header of its own. tidalapi's
    ``get_hls()`` lists the init segment as if it were audio and never emits
    ``#EXT-X-MAP``, so ffmpeg opens each segment on its own, finds no ``trex``
    for the fragments, and gives up with "error reading header". Verified
    against a real hi-res track: 69 segments, segment 0 is ``ftyp+moov`` and
    the rest are ``moof+mdat``.
